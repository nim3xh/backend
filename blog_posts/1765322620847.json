  "excerpt": "Prop trading isn’t about adrenaline or clever guesses. It’s about rhythm. Structure. A predictable daily flow that keeps you inside the rules while giving your edge room to work.",
  "content": "<p>Short-term trading inside a prop firm evaluation or funded account benefits from structure more than anything else. A defined routine helps you stay within firm rules, reduces impulsive behavior, and creates consistency—qualities prop firms look for far more than high-risk trading or oversized wins.</p><p>TradeRx fits naturally into that routine as a tool that enforces timing, risk parameters, and rules you have already defined. It does not replace judgment or experience; it supports it by ensuring day-to-day execution follows a predictable, disciplined pattern.</p><p>What follows is a practical framework for building a reliable daily routine using TradeRx—one that aligns with evaluation requirements, adapts to market conditions, and keeps multiple accounts organized without unnecessary complexity.</p><hr><h2><strong>Why a Daily Routine Matters in Prop Trading</strong></h2><p>Most traders who struggle during evaluations do not fail because their strategy is inadequate—they fail because the trading day has no structure.</p><p>Evaluations and funded accounts introduce constraints such as:</p><ul><li><p>Daily loss limits</p></li><li><p>Trailing drawdown</p></li><li><p>Minimum trading days</p></li><li><p>Restricted trading windows</p></li><li><p>Max trades per day</p></li></ul><p>A routine turns these restrictions into a manageable workflow.<br>Rather than watching every rule every moment, you work through a checklist and let TradeRx enforce the limits during live execution.</p><hr><h1><strong>Pre-Market Routine</strong></h1><p>A day that begins with clarity tends to stay consistent.<br>A day that begins with guesswork tends to drift.</p><p>Below is a routine built for evaluation and funded account environments.</p><hr><h2><strong>1. Load the Correct Rule Set</strong></h2><p>Evaluation and funded accounts often operate under different parameters.<br>TradeRx reads rule files you have prepared:</p><ul><li><p><strong>evaluation-rules.csv</strong> for accounts still in the challenge</p></li><li><p><strong>funded-rules.csv</strong> for accounts eligible for payout</p></li></ul><p>Confirm that each account is linked to the correct file before trading begins.</p><p>This helps prevent avoidable rule violations—such as taking trades during news events when the rules forbid it or using position sizes above the funded account’s maximum.</p><hr><h2><strong>2. Verify Account Status</strong></h2><p>Before trading starts, review each account:</p><ul><li><p>Current balance</p></li><li><p>Distance to daily loss limit</p></li><li><p>Distance to trailing drawdown</p></li><li><p>Remaining evaluation days</p></li><li><p>Progress toward profit target</p></li></ul><p>This determines which accounts should trade normally, which should trade conservatively, and which may need to pause for the day.</p><p>Example:<br>An evaluation account that is already above its profit target may not need to trade further until minimum day requirements are fulfilled.</p><hr><h2><strong>3. Check Scheduled Events</strong></h2><p>Whether you can trade during economic releases depends on your evaluation rules.</p><p>If your rules restrict event trading, TradeRx can block trades for a buffer window around the event.<br>If trading is allowed, you may still choose to reduce size or avoid certain setups based on your experience.</p><p>This step helps prevent unnecessary volatility exposure.</p><hr><h2><strong>4. Review the Daily Trade Plan</strong></h2><p>If you use Dr. Markets to generate your trade plans, each account will have:</p><ul><li><p>Stop loss (SL)</p></li><li><p>Take profit (TP)</p></li><li><p>Trailing stop parameters</p></li><li><p>Position size</p></li><li><p>Direction (if predetermined)</p></li><li><p>A scheduled entry time</p></li></ul><p>TradeRx converts these dollar-based values into instrument-appropriate tick distances and prepares the day’s execution schedule.</p><p>The goal here is simple: ensure the plan matches your intent before the market opens.</p><hr><h2><strong>5. Stagger Account Timing</strong></h2><p>When managing multiple accounts, it is good practice to vary the entry times.<br>This reduces operational strain and reflects natural trading behavior.</p><p>TradeRx assigns unique timing offsets without repetition.<br>You remain in control of the timing ranges; TradeRx ensures consistency.</p><hr><h1><strong>Live Execution Routine</strong></h1><p>Once the market opens, your role shifts from planning to oversight.</p><p>TradeRx manages:</p><ul><li><p>Scheduled entries</p></li><li><p>Stop placements</p></li><li><p>Risk limits</p></li><li><p>Event restrictions</p></li><li><p>End-of-day cutoffs</p></li></ul><p>Your responsibility becomes monitoring conditions and stepping in only if market structure or news flow requires manual adjustment.</p><hr><h2><strong>6. Supervising Active Trades</strong></h2><p>During execution, focus on:</p><ul><li><p>Trade quality vs. plan</p></li><li><p>Fill speed and slippage</p></li><li><p>Whether market conditions have meaningfully changed</p></li></ul><p>This approach separates strategic oversight (your job) from mechanical execution (TradeRx’s job).</p><hr><h2><strong>7. Mid-Session Adjustments</strong></h2><p>Markets can change quickly due to unscheduled announcements, unusual volatility, or unexpected liquidity behavior.</p><p>Practical adjustments include:</p><ul><li><p>Pausing an account for the remainder of the session</p></li><li><p>Reducing exposure for specific instruments</p></li><li><p>Closing a trade early if structure breaks</p></li><li><p>Avoiding a scheduled trade if the environment has shifted</p></li></ul><p>The aim is not to override the system frequently but to make informed decisions when market conditions differ from what your plan anticipated.</p><hr><h1><strong>End-of-Day Routine</strong></h1><p>When your rules-based cutoff time arrives, TradeRx stops scheduling new trades and closes open positions.</p><p>Your routine concludes with:</p><ul><li><p>Reviewing execution logs</p></li><li><p>Comparing balances with targets</p></li><li><p>Noting which accounts moved closer to evaluation or payout thresholds</p></li><li><p>Adjusting tomorrow’s plan only if necessary</p></li></ul><p>This review does not need to be time-consuming.<br>A simple daily snapshot is enough to maintain discipline and spot drift early.</p><hr><h1><strong>Real Examples of Daily Routines in Practice</strong></h1><p>Here are simplified examples based on real prop firm conditions.</p><hr><h3><strong>Example 1 — A Structured Evaluation Day</strong></h3><p>Firm: Leeloo<br>Rule Focus: Avoid large swings early in the day</p><p>Routine:</p><ul><li><p>No trading before 9:40 AM</p></li><li><p>Only one ES trade per account before noon</p></li><li><p>Skip trading entirely after two consecutive wins</p></li></ul><p>Outcome:<br>Stable progress toward target over multiple days, low risk of rule violation.</p><hr><h3><strong>Example 2 — Managing Funded Accounts for Payout</strong></h3><p>Firm: Apex<br>Rule Focus: Protect the trailing threshold</p><p>Routine:</p><ul><li><p>Reduce size once near payout level</p></li><li><p>Disable trades during major news events</p></li><li><p>Pause accounts once daily profitability is met</p></li></ul><p>Outcome:<br>Traders preserved funded status across the payout cycle.</p><hr><h3><strong>Example 3 — Heavy Multi-Account Workload</strong></h3><p>Firms: Topstep + Uprofit<br>Rule Focus: Different rules per account</p><p>Routine:</p><ul><li><p>TradeRx applies evaluation rules to Uprofit accounts</p></li><li><p>TradeRx applies funded rules to Topstep</p></li><li><p>Each account receives its own trade time and risk profile</p></li></ul><p>Outcome:<br>Clear separation of logic, reduced manual tracking, fewer rule conflicts.</p><hr><h1><strong>FAQ — Building a Daily Routine with TradeRx</strong></h1><p><strong>Does TradeRx replace trading decisions?</strong><br>No. It executes the plan you’ve already defined and ensures rule consistency.</p><p><strong>Can I use one routine for both evaluation and funded accounts?</strong><br>The structure can be similar, but parameters must differ. TradeRx handles this cleanly.</p><p><strong>What if I’m close to passing an evaluation?</strong><br>You can reduce or skip trading to avoid unnecessary risk.</p><p><strong>Does TradeRx automatically avoid news?</strong><br>Only if your rules specify it. You can configure the buffer window.</p><p><strong>What reports does TradeRx generate at the end of the day?</strong><br>Execution logs for all accounts, including entries, exits, PnL, and account status.</p><p><strong>Can I intervene manually?</strong><br>Yes. You can pause or close trades without disrupting the overall routine.</p>",
