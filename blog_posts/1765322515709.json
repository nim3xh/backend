  "content": "<h1><strong>How to Configure Dr. Markets Rules for Evaluation Accounts</strong></h1><p>Prop firm evaluations look simple on paper—hit the profit target, avoid breaking rules, and trade for a minimum number of days. In practice, they’re tight corridors with almost no room for error. One slip into daily drawdown, one misplaced trade near a news event, one oversized position during volatility, and the evaluation ends instantly.</p><p>Dr. Markets exists to prevent that.<br>Instead of manually tracking dozens of constraints while trying to read a fast-moving ES, NQ, or GC chart, Dr. Markets applies every evaluation rule in real time. It checks your trade size before you place it, blocks you from entering during restricted windows, adjusts stops and targets based on risk parameters, and helps your account survive long enough to pass.</p><p>This guide breaks down how to configure Dr. Markets so your evaluation account runs with the same discipline and structure as a professional trading desk.</p><hr><h1><strong>Load the Correct Evaluation Rules File</strong></h1><p>Everything starts with the rules file—usually named:</p><p><strong>evaluation-rules.csv</strong></p><p>This file tells Dr. Markets the boundaries it must operate within. Typical fields include:</p><p>◇ <strong>Account Size</strong> — $50K, $100K, $150K<br>◇ <strong>Balance to Pass</strong> — the profit objective<br>◇ <strong>Max Profit Per Trade</strong> — if the firm enforces a cap<br>◇ <strong>Trade Start / End Times</strong> — when trading is allowed<br>◇ <strong>Event Trading Allowed</strong> — Yes or No</p><p>Since prop firms tweak rules often, always verify that your evaluation-rules.csv reflects the current conditions. Dr. Markets runs exactly what the file instructs—it won’t “guess” the rules for you.</p><hr><h1><strong>Configure Stop Loss Logic (SL)</strong></h1><p>A well-configured SL can make the difference between passing cleanly and failing from a single bad rotation.</p><p>Dr. Markets builds SL using two methods:</p><p><strong>1. Fixed SL from the rules file</strong><br>Example: A flat $150-per-trade stop.</p><p><strong>2. Smart SL based on drawdown limits</strong><br>Using formulas such as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>SL Min = Max Drawdown ÷ 22</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SL Max = Max Drawdown ÷ Minimum Trading Days</strong></p></li></ul><p>After calculation, SL is always refined to:</p><p>◇ Be divisible by <strong>$50</strong><br>◇ Round to the nearest <strong>$25</strong></p><p>This keeps risk consistent and prevents awkward, unnatural position sizing.</p><p><strong>Example (ES):</strong><br>Max DD = $2,500 → workable stops between ~$113 and ~$416<br>Morning may use a tighter SL; afternoon trades slightly wider to match volatility.</p><hr><h1><strong>Define Take Profit (TP) Rules</strong></h1><p>TP determines how quickly you can reach the evaluation target without risking disqualification.</p><p>Dr. Markets selects TP using this hierarchy:</p><p>◇ <strong>If Max Profit Per Trade is defined → use it</strong><br>◇ <strong>If TP = “TradeRx” → target = |current balance – pass balance|</strong><br>◇ <strong>If nothing is defined → TP = SL × 5</strong></p><p>This ensures TP aligns with your account goals instead of random guesswork.</p><p><strong>Example (NQ):</strong><br>SL = $300 → TP = $1,500<br>Perfect for evaluations where steady accumulation beats oversized swings.</p><hr><h1><strong>Set Trailing Stops (TSL) and Trigger Levels (TSLT)</strong></h1><p>These apply only when <strong>SL &gt; $250</strong>, since small stops don’t benefit from trailing logic.</p><p>Dr. Markets uses:</p><p>◇ <strong>TSL = Breakeven Rule × SL</strong><br>◇ <strong>TSLT = SL</strong></p><p><strong>Example (GC):</strong><br>SL = $400, Breakeven = 0.5 → TSL = $200, TSLT = $400</p><p>You get room for price to breathe, but still protect profits when the move begins to fade.</p><hr><h1><strong>Calculate Position Size with Precision</strong></h1><p>Size is determined using:</p><p><strong>Quantity = SL ÷ 250</strong></p><p>With constraints:</p><p>◇ Minimum = <strong>1 contract</strong><br>◇ Maximum = <strong>max-contracts-per-trade</strong> from rules</p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br>SL = $500 → Quantity = <strong>2 contracts</strong></p><p>This sizing formula keeps your risk aligned with funded-firm expectations.</p><hr><h1><strong>Assign Trade Times That Look Human, Not Robotic</strong></h1><p>Prop firms disqualify accounts for suspicious timing consistency.<br>Dr. Markets solves this by spacing trades naturally:</p><p>◇ Unique trade offsets (13–27 minutes)<br>◇ Alternating early- and mid-session entries<br>◇ Avoidance of event windows</p><p>Your account behaves like a disciplined discretionary trader—not a naive timer bot.</p><hr><h1><strong>Enable Event Avoidance Logic</strong></h1><p>If the rules file specifies <strong>Event Trading Allowed = No</strong>, Dr. Markets protects your account by blocking trades:</p><p>◇ <strong>15 minutes before</strong> the event<br>◇ <strong>15 minutes after</strong> the event</p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br>FOMC at 2:00 PM → No trades from <strong>1:45–2:15 PM</strong>.</p><p>This alone prevents a huge percentage of evaluation failures.</p><hr><h1><strong>Apply Re-entry Rules</strong></h1><p>Evaluation accounts reward discipline, not frequency.</p><p>Dr. Markets uses:</p><p>◇ <strong>If Max Trades Per Day = 1 → stop after one trade</strong><br>◇ <strong>If more than one trade allowed → only re-enter after a loss</strong></p><p>This reduces overtrading and helps maintain consistency scores.</p><hr><h1><strong>Monitor the Account Like a Full-Time Risk Manager</strong></h1><p>Once configured, Dr. Markets continuously monitors:</p><p>◇ Balance before and after each trade<br>◇ Distance to daily/max drawdown<br>◇ Distance to pass target<br>◇ Timing restrictions<br>◇ Contract sizing compliance</p><p>When your account crosses the pass threshold—even mid-session—Dr. Markets halts trading automatically. No accidental forfeits.</p><hr><h1><strong>Reach the Goal Without Needing a Renewal</strong></h1><p>Evaluation success is a mix of precision and patience.<br>To help you finish early and avoid renewals, Dr. Markets:</p><p>◇ Targets clean, structured trades<br>◇ Keeps risk proportional<br>◇ Avoids volatility traps<br>◇ Reduces size when margins get tight</p><p>It performs like a trader who knows the rules so well they never come close to breaking them.</p><hr><h1><strong>FAQ — Configuring Dr. Markets for Evaluation Accounts</strong></h1><p><strong>Do I need to update the rules file for each evaluation?</strong><br>Yes. Always load a fresh copy to match current prop firm terms.</p><p><strong>Can Dr. Markets run multiple evaluation accounts at once?</strong><br>Yes. Use separate rules files per account type.</p><p><strong>How does it choose SL values?</strong><br>It blends rule-based logic with natural sizing standards.</p><p><strong>What happens if I pass in the middle of the day?</strong><br>Trading for that account stops immediately.</p><p><strong>Can I trade news?</strong><br>Only if your firm allows it and Event Trading = Yes.</p><p><strong>Does it ever exceed max trades per day?</strong><br>No—limits are enforced strictly.</p><p><strong>What if I’m running out of evaluation days?</strong><br>It adjusts TP logic (within rules) to help finish on time.</p><p><strong>Do funded accounts follow the same rules?</strong><br>No—funded logic focuses on payout consistency, not passing quickly.</p>",
