The most consistent evaluation passes and funded payouts come from traders who review their systems every morning, monitor during the session, and close the day with accurate logs.</p><p>A daily checklist doesn’t remove the work—it organizes it. It reduces uncertainty, creates a repeatable workflow, and keeps automated systems aligned with prop firm rules. Below is a practical checklist you can use to maintain control and consistency across evaluations and funded accounts.</p><hr><h1><strong>Why Daily Checklists Matter in Prop Trading Automation</strong></h1><p>Prop firms design rules to reduce unnecessary risk. These rules—daily loss limits, event restrictions, cutoff times, scaling limits—form the framework you must operate within. Automation helps enforce them, but automation still depends on correct setup.</p><p>A daily checklist ensures that:</p><p>◇ Subscription status and trading permissions are confirmed<br>◇ Account conditions match prop firm requirements<br>◇ Trade plans are accurate, complete, and up to date<br>◇ Evaluation accounts avoid renewals and rule breaches<br>◇ Funded accounts stay within payout eligibility</p><p>Most failures in automated prop trading aren’t caused by bad strategies—they’re caused by missing a single rule or oversight. A checklist prevents that.</p><hr><h1><strong>Step One: Morning System Check</strong></h1><p>Before charts load or trades begin, confirm that your automation environment is ready.</p><h3><strong>Subscription Validation</strong></h3><p>Verify the active status from Dr. Markets. If the trading-day flag is set to “No,” automation should not continue.</p><h3><strong>Rules File Check</strong></h3><p>Load evaluation or funded account rule files and confirm key elements:</p><p>◇ Balance-to-Pass or Balance-to-Payout<br>◇ Max drawdown<br>◇ Event trading permissions<br>◇ Trade start/end windows</p><h3><strong>Account Status Review</strong></h3><p>Identify accounts that should not trade today:</p><p>◇ Evaluation accounts already above the pass threshold<br>◇ Funded accounts below allowed drawdown<br>◇ Accounts paused intentionally for risk reduction</p><p>Clear status markers in the morning help avoid unnecessary trades or violations later in the day.</p><hr><h1><strong>Step Two: Trade Plan Confirmation</strong></h1><p>If Dr. Markets generates your trade plan files, review them before TradeRx executes anything.</p><h3><strong>File Availability</strong></h3><p>Trade plans should update daily. If the expected files are missing, do not guess—wait for proper generation.</p><h3><strong>Stop Loss and Take Profit Integrity</strong></h3><p>Check SL and TP values:</p><p>◇ SL should meet minimum size rules and rounding conventions<br>◇ TP must match either firm rules or dynamic TradeRx logic</p><p>Inaccurate values can skew risk and create rule violations.</p><h3><strong>Contract Quantity</strong></h3><p>Position size should always match the account’s allowed parameters. A single oversized contract can disqualify an account instantly.</p><h3><strong>Time Assignments</strong></h3><p>Review assigned trade times to ensure:</p><p>◇ Staggered execution<br>◇ No clustering<br>◇ No overlap with event windows</p><p>TradeRx spacing often reflects natural human timing; a quick review confirms everything looks correct.</p><hr><h1><strong>Step Three: Market Readiness</strong></h1><p>Automation performs best when the environment is understood ahead of time.</p><h3><strong>Market Hours Check</strong></h3><p>Ensure the U.S. futures market is open. Pre-open anomalies or holiday hours may require pausing automation.</p><h3><strong>Event Awareness</strong></h3><p>Compare the day’s economic calendar with your account rules. If event trading is restricted:</p><p>◇ Avoid the event window<br>◇ Block ±15 minutes around major releases</p><h3><strong>Instrument Validation</strong></h3><p>TradeRx only runs on U.S. futures like ES, NQ, or GC. If another instrument is open on your NinjaTrader chart, the strategy will not proceed.</p><hr><h1><strong>Step Four: Execution Oversight</strong></h1><p>Automation manages the trades, but oversight ensures alignment with expectations.</p><h3><strong>Human-Like Timing Review</strong></h3><p>Look for:</p><p>◇ 13–27 minute spacing<br>◇ Variation between accounts<br>◇ No repeated gaps that suggest patterns</p><p>These details help maintain natural execution behavior.</p><h3><strong>Direction Confirmation</strong></h3><p>Dr. Markets assigns direction, but a quick glance at recent candles validates logic:</p><p>◇ Two red bars often align with short setups<br>◇ Two green bars with longs</p><p>It isn’t discretionary override—it’s situational awareness.</p><h3><strong>Re-Entry Conditions</strong></h3><p>Re-entry should occur only after a losing trade, never after a win. This mirrors many prop firm structures and prevents unnecessary overtrading.</p><hr><h1><strong>Step Five: End-of-Day Review</strong></h1><p>Automation doesn’t close your trading day—you do.</p><h3><strong>Execution Log Review</strong></h3><p>Check the day’s CSV logs for:</p><p>◇ SL/TP behavior<br>◇ Direction accuracy<br>◇ Balance adjustments<br>◇ Notes such as “PASS,” “Below Drawdown,” “Account Skipped”</p><p>Logs tell the real story of the day’s decisions and outcomes.</p><h3><strong>Pending or Late Trades</strong></h3><p>TradeRx may schedule final trades near 9 PM EST for accounts that haven’t completed their allotment. Make sure these trades align with your plan.</p><h3><strong>Performance Summary</strong></h3><p>Dr. Markets produces a daily performance summary. Use it to track consistency, risk alignment, and whether today’s trades moved accounts closer to or further from their objectives.</p><hr><h1><strong>Real-World Example: The Missed Checklist</strong></h1><p>A trader managing three accounts skipped his morning routine on a high-impact news day. He assumed event restrictions were active on all accounts. One funded account traded through an event window and was breached.</p><p>After adding “event restrictions check” to his morning list, his daily setup time increased by less than ten minutes. He not only avoided further rule violations but also earned two clean payout cycles in a row.</p><p>Automation multiplies discipline—but only if the trader maintains the structure behind it.</p><hr><h1><strong>FAQs</strong></h1><p><strong>Why isn’t “set and forget” enough for prop automation?</strong><br>Because prop trading rules can change daily. Without review, automation might act on outdated conditions.</p><p><strong>How long should this checklist take?</strong><br>Typically under 15 minutes once it becomes routine.</p><p><strong>Should evaluation and funded accounts have separate checklists?</strong><br>Yes. Evaluations aim for the pass threshold; funded accounts prioritize drawdown safety and payout stability.</p><p><strong>Does TradeRx enforce cutoff times automatically?</strong><br>Yes, but your checklist ensures trade plans and timing align with those cutoffs from the start.</p><p><strong>Can traders add personal rules to the checklist?</strong><br>Absolutely. Many include items like checking internet stability, workstation readiness, or family commitments.</p>",
