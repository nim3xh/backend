  "content": "<p>One of the most common questions traders ask when they first discover Technests is:<br><strong>“Can your bots trade everything?”</strong></p><p>The answer is deliberately simple: <strong>No. And that’s by design.</strong></p><p>Technests was never meant to be a universal bot that jumps from stocks one day to crypto the next. In fact, bots that “trade everything” usually fail everywhere. Markets behave differently, liquidity varies dramatically, and prop firm rules don’t adapt to every asset class.</p><p>Instead, Technests focuses on the <strong>only markets that actually matter for serious prop traders</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ES — E-mini S&amp;P 500 Futures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>NQ — E-mini Nasdaq 100 Futures</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>GC — COMEX Gold Futures</strong></p></li></ul><p>This isn’t a limitation. It’s a specialization. And specialization is what keeps traders funded — and in business.</p><p>Let’s break down why these three futures contracts are the foundation of prop trading, why Technests intentionally ignores everything else, and what this means for traders who want automation that survives real-world rules and real-world conditions.</p><hr><h2><strong>Prop Trading Runs on Futures — Not Stocks, Crypto, or Forex</strong></h2><p>If you look at the largest prop firms — Apex, Topstep, Leeloo, UProfit, Bulenox — they all center their offerings around U.S. futures. There’s a reason for that:</p><p>◇ <strong>Liquidity</strong><br>Futures markets are among the deepest markets in the world. ES and NQ alone trade billions in notional value daily. When liquidity is this strong, you get tight spreads and reliable fills — essential for both manual and automated execution.</p><p>◇ <strong>Regulation &amp; Transparency</strong><br>Futures are centrally cleared and regulated by the CFTC. You’re not dealing with fragmented brokers (stocks), shady exchanges (crypto), or dealer-driven pricing (retail forex).</p><p>◇ <strong>Uniform Market Access</strong><br>A trader in Dubai sees the same ES tick as a trader in Chicago. No regional liquidity gaps. No exchange routing nonsense.</p><p>◇ <strong>Prop Firm Infrastructure</strong><br>Risk desks know how to model ES, NQ, and GC. Their rules — trailing drawdown, scaling limits, consistency — all exist because these markets behave predictably enough to standardize.</p><p>For prop traders, futures aren’t optional. They’re the environment you operate in. And any automation that ignores this reality is already starting with a disadvantage.</p><hr><h2><strong>Why ES, NQ, and GC Are the Only Markets Worth Automating</strong></h2><p>Yes, futures contracts come in many flavors — oil, bonds, currencies, grains, metals. But automation must be risk-aware, rule-aware, and liquidity-aware. That’s why Technests focuses exclusively on three contracts.</p><hr><h3><strong>ES — The Institutional Benchmark</strong></h3><p>ES is the backbone of U.S. equity futures.</p><p>◇ Stable behavior<br>◇ Clear liquidity zones<br>◇ Very low slippage<br>◇ Ideal for rule-based systems<br>◇ Preferred instrument for prop evaluations</p><p>If you can’t survive trading ES, no automation will save you anywhere else.</p><hr><h3><strong>NQ — The High-Volatility Opportunity Engine</strong></h3><p>NQ is faster and more aggressive than ES. It offers:</p><p>◇ Larger intraday ranges<br>◇ Faster trends<br>◇ Explosive moves during tech-heavy news cycles</p><p>But that volatility is a double-edged sword. Many traders blow accounts on NQ because they underestimate its power. TradeRx handles position sizing, loss limits, and execution precision — reducing the human-error factor that destroys accounts.</p><hr><h3><strong>GC — The Diversifier with Global Flow</strong></h3><p>Gold behaves differently. It’s driven by:</p><p>◇ Interest rate expectations<br>◇ Inflation data<br>◇ Geopolitical tension<br>◇ Risk-on/risk-off rotations</p><p>GC often moves when ES and NQ stall. That makes it a critical instrument for traders who want balance without chasing exotic markets with unpredictable behavior.</p><hr><h2><strong>Why Technests Avoids Other Markets on Purpose</strong></h2><p>Automation isn’t about “trading everything.”<br>It’s about trading what you can <strong>control</strong>, <strong>monitor</strong>, and <strong>survive</strong>.</p><p>Here’s why Technests avoids some popular futures markets:</p><hr><h3><strong>Crude Oil (CL)</strong></h3><p>CL is tradable — but extremely unsafe for automation:</p><p>◇ Massive intraday spikes<br>◇ Whipsaw reactions to geopolitical events<br>◇ Thin liquidity at certain hours<br>◇ Higher slippage in fast markets</p><p>Many prop accounts die on CL. Technests won’t encourage that behavior.</p><hr><h3><strong>Forex</strong></h3><p>Retail forex is decentralized. Spreads and liquidity vary by broker, and slippage is often invisible. Prop firms know this — which is why most don’t support direct forex trading.</p><hr><h3><strong>Crypto</strong></h3><p>Crypto markets are unregulated, fragmented, and prone to manipulation.<br>They’re exciting — but not survivable in a compliance-driven environment.</p><hr><h2><strong>The Discipline Advantage: Focusing Only on ES, NQ, and GC</strong></h2><p>Traders fail not because they trade too little — but because they trade too much.</p><p>By keeping automation limited to three reliable contracts:</p><p>◇ You avoid dangerous markets<br>◇ You build deeper expertise<br>◇ You execute more consistently<br>◇ You protect funded accounts<br>◇ You follow prop firm expectations more naturally</p><p>Focus builds edge. Edge builds payouts.</p><hr><h2><strong>How Dr. Markets Plans Across ES, NQ, and GC</strong></h2><p>Dr. Markets doesn’t look for random setups. It evaluates each contract independently:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ES</strong> → liquidity nodes, VWAP structures, institutional behavior</p></li><li><p><strong>NQ</strong> → volatility regimes, trend acceleration, compression/release cycles</p></li><li><p><strong>GC</strong> → macro catalysts, rate-sensitive reactions, overnight flows</p></li></ul><p>It then builds a rule-aligned trade plan around:</p><p>◇ Prop firm restrictions<br>◇ News events<br>◇ Required trading days<br>◇ Risk envelopes<br>◇ Position sizing limits</p><p>You never walk into a session blind again.</p><hr><h2><strong>How TradeRx Executes These Plans Without Breaking Rules</strong></h2><p>TradeRx enforces discipline across ES, NQ, and GC by:</p><p>◇ Blocking trades near trailing drawdown thresholds<br>◇ Preventing entries during CPI, FOMC, NFP, and restricted prop firm windows<br>◇ Capturing screenshots and video proof for audits<br>◇ Pausing after consecutive losses to reduce emotional risk<br>◇ Handling execution routing through futures-approved gateways</p><p>TradeRx does not override market realities. It cannot control:</p><ul><li><p>platform outages</p></li><li><p>network instability</p></li><li><p>extreme volatility spikes</p></li><li><p>poor fills from broker-side issues</p></li></ul><p>But it <em>can</em> prevent avoidable mistakes — the kind traders repeatedly make.</p><hr><h2><strong>Real Examples of Why ES, NQ, and GC Matter</strong></h2><h3><strong>Example 1: ES During FOMC</strong></h3><p>Most losses come from traders forgetting or ignoring the blackout window.<br>Dr. Markets blocks the event pre-market.<br>TradeRx prevents execution automatically.<br>Account stays safe.</p><h3><strong>Example 2: NQ Midday Whipsaw</strong></h3><p>NQ traders often oversize after a win.<br>TradeRx detects abnormal sizing behavior and blocks the trade.<br>Disaster avoided.</p><h3><strong>Example 3: GC as a Risk Hedge</strong></h3><p>When ES &amp; NQ stall, GC often trends.<br>Dr. Markets allocates safe exposure.<br>TradeRx executes within account-specific limits.</p><hr><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><p><strong>Can Technests trade other markets?</strong><br>No. We intentionally limit markets to maximize safety, compliance, and longevity.</p><p><strong>Will other markets be added later?</strong><br>Only if they meet liquidity, regulation, and prop-firm stability standards.</p><p><strong>Why not YM or RTY?</strong><br>Lower liquidity and less prop-firm focus. ES and NQ already provide the structure traders need.</p><p><strong>Can I trade overnight?</strong><br>Plans may include extended hours, especially in GC, but Dr. Markets avoids dead liquidity zones.</p><p><strong>Do ES, NQ, and GC really cover enough opportunity?</strong><br>Yes. These three markets generate daily tradeable movement year-round.</p><hr><h2><strong>Focus on Markets That Actually Matter</strong></h2><p>Technests bots don’t chase hype.<br>They don’t try to trade everything.<br>They focus on ES, NQ, and GC — the contracts where:</p><ul><li><p>liquidity is highest</p></li><li><p>rules are clearest</p></li><li><p>prop firms operate</p></li><li><p>automation is actually viable</p></li><li><p>consistency is achievable</p></li></ul><p>You don’t need 20 markets to succeed.<br>You need <strong>three good ones</strong> — traded with structure, precision, and discipline.</p><hr><h2><strong>Automate the Markets Built for Prop Traders</strong></h2><p>If you’re serious about prop trading, don’t waste time on unregulated or unreliable markets. Build your automation stack on ES, NQ, and GC — the contracts that prop firms trust and professionals rely on daily.</p><p>Dr. Markets and TradeRx are built specifically for these markets, these rules, and this environment.</p><p>👉 Explore the US Futures advantage at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80\" href=\"http://Technests.ai\"><strong>Technests.ai</strong></a></p>",
