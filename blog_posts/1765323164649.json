  "content": "<p>In prop trading, results aren’t measured only by profit. Evaluations and funded accounts operate under strict rule sets—daily loss limits, trailing drawdowns, cut-off times, minimum trading days, and payout eligibility requirements. The only reliable way to monitor your position inside those rules is through detailed performance logging.</p><p>Execution logs offer a structured view of your trading behavior. They don’t rely on memory, emotion, or interpretation. They show exactly what happened, when it happened, and how it affected your account. For traders using automated systems such as Dr. Markets or TradeRx, logs become even more central because they document not just outcomes, but rule-based decisions.</p><p>This article outlines how to read, use, and benefit from execution logs in a practical, prop-firm-focused way.</p><hr><h1><strong>What Execution Logs Actually Are</strong></h1><p>Execution logs are structured datasets—typically CSV files—that record each trade with full transparency. A comprehensive log includes:</p><p>◇ Account identifier (evaluation or funded)<br>◇ Instrument traded (ES, NQ, GC, etc.)<br>◇ Entry and exit timestamps<br>◇ Trade direction<br>◇ Stop Loss, Take Profit, and any trailing parameters<br>◇ Quantity and price<br>◇ Balance before and after the trade<br>◇ Profit or loss on the position<br>◇ Compliance notes (e.g., “PASS,” “Cutoff Applied,” “Hit Max Drawdown”)</p><p>Rather than waiting for a broker statement at the end of the day or week, execution logs provide a real-time snapshot of account health and rule adherence.</p><hr><h1><strong>Why Execution Logs Matter in Prop Trading</strong></h1><p>Prop firms evaluate much more than profitability. A trader can have a strong strategy and still lose an evaluation by:</p><p>◇ Trading too close to the daily loss limit<br>◇ Violating a news-event restriction<br>◇ Exceeding maximum trades per day<br>◇ Trading past the cut-off window<br>◇ Ignoring trailing drawdown dynamics</p><p>Execution logs reveal these risks as they develop. They create visibility into how trades interact with account rules—something no chart screenshot can provide.</p><p>Over time, logs also give traders a fact-based view of their performance patterns, removing the bias of “it felt like a good day.”</p><hr><h1><strong>How Dr. Markets and TradeRx Use Logs</strong></h1><p>At Technests, logging is built into the workflow:</p><p>◇ <strong>Dr. Markets</strong> generates trade plans—SL, TP, trailing logic, quantity, and scheduled entry times.<br>◇ <strong>TradeRx</strong> executes trades from those plans and records every detail into execution logs.</p><p>This separation creates a complete before-and-after view:<br><em>What was planned, what happened, and how the account reacted.</em></p><p>For multi-account traders, this clarity is essential. Each evaluation or funded account follows its own rule file. Execution logs reflect those differences so that each account can be reviewed independently.</p><hr><h1><strong>Key Metrics to Track in Your Logs</strong></h1><p>A well-maintained log allows you to track meaningful performance statistics:</p><p>◇ <strong>Win rate</strong> — percentage of trades that closed positive<br>◇ <strong>Profit factor</strong> — total profit ÷ total loss<br>◇ <strong>Expectancy per trade</strong> — the average value of a single trade<br>◇ <strong>Maximum drawdown</strong> — the largest peak-to-trough drop<br>◇ <strong>Average risk-to-reward (R-multiple)</strong><br>◇ <strong>Time-of-day performance</strong><br>◇ <strong>Evaluation progress</strong> — distance to pass threshold<br>◇ <strong>Funded eligibility</strong> — whether the balance meets payout requirements</p><p>These metrics are the backbone of professional trading review.</p><hr><h1><strong>Using Logs to Identify Weaknesses</strong></h1><p>Patterns emerge quickly once logs accumulate across multiple sessions.<br>Common insights include:</p><p>◇ <strong>Repeated losses at the same time of day</strong> → poor session choice<br>◇ <strong>Frequent SL hits</strong> → stops may be too tight or volatility unaccounted for<br>◇ <strong>Large winners offset by numerous small losses</strong> → overtrading or poor trade filtering<br>◇ <strong>Entry clustering</strong> → breaking plan or reacting emotionally<br>◇ <strong>Late-day losses</strong> → ignoring cut-off timing constraints</p><p>Logs expose behavior that feels subtle during the day but becomes obvious with data.</p><hr><h1><strong>Logs as a Compliance Tool</strong></h1><p>Prop firms enforce rules rigorously, and even small violations can end an evaluation. Logs help you anticipate risk before the firm flags it.</p><p>Examples of compliance checks:</p><p>◇ Monitoring distance to trailing drawdown<br>◇ Confirming trades were closed before required cut-off time<br>◇ Checking that event-restricted periods were avoided<br>◇ Verifying number of daily trades stayed within limits<br>◇ Ensuring accounts near the pass threshold did not continue trading unnecessarily</p><p>Logs protect traders from unintentional rule breaks—and from losing funded status due to avoidable errors.</p><hr><h1><strong>Visualizing Logs for Better Insight</strong></h1><p>Raw CSV files are powerful, but visuals make patterns easier to interpret. Importing logs into Excel, Google Sheets, or more advanced dashboards creates:</p><p>◇ Equity curves showing growth, stagnation, or decay<br>◇ Outcome distributions revealing skew and volatility<br>◇ Session-based heat maps of performance<br>◇ Trade-frequency charts to detect overtrading<br>◇ SL/TP effectiveness charts</p><p>Visuals convert long rows of data into quick decision-making tools.</p><hr><h1><strong>Case Study: Evaluation Account Tracking</strong></h1><p>A trader runs a $50K evaluation over two weeks. Execution logs show:</p><p>◇ Win rate: 48%<br>◇ Profit factor: 1.7<br>◇ Max drawdown: $950 (below the $1,100 limit)<br>◇ Equity rising with controlled variance</p><p>Even though the win rate was below 50%, the evaluation remained stable because trade sizing and SL/TP logic aligned with the rules.</p><p>The logs confirmed that the trader could continue trading without rule adjustments.</p><hr><h1><strong>Case Study: Funded Account Monitoring</strong></h1><p>Another trader manages a $100K funded account. Logs reveal:</p><p>◇ Several days of excessive trade frequency<br>◇ Targets consistently reached faster than stop losses<br>◇ Account flagged as payout-eligible</p><p>By catching frequency issues early, the trader reduced overtrading risk and maintained a clean record before payout.</p><p>Without logs, the overtrading pattern would not have been obvious.</p><hr><h1><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1><p><strong>Why can’t I rely only on broker statements?</strong><br>Statements lack detail and often arrive too late to inform active decisions. Execution logs update trade-by-trade.</p><p><strong>Do I need logs for every account?</strong><br>Yes. Prop firms evaluate accounts individually. Logs prevent mixing data across accounts.</p><p><strong>How often should I review logs?</strong><br>Daily review is ideal; weekly summaries reveal broader behavioral patterns.</p><p><strong>Are logs only for automated traders?</strong><br>No. Manual traders benefit greatly from structured data beyond broker timestamps.</p><p><strong>What tools work best for analyzing logs?</strong><br>Excel, Google Sheets, Power BI, Tableau, and Python notebooks all work depending on skill level.</p><p><strong>How do logs help with compliance?</strong><br>They show whether you respected event windows, cut-off times, daily loss limits, and maximum trade rules.</p><p><strong>Can logs expose psychological patterns?</strong><br>Yes. Revenge trading, hesitation, or trading outside plan hours show up clearly in the data.</p><p><strong>How do I know if my SL and TP levels are effective?</strong><br>Contrast SL/TP hits across 30+ trades. A strong strategy typically has a profit factor above 1.3 with controlled variance.</p><p><strong>Should logs be stored long-term?</strong><br>Yes. They create a performance history useful for refining systems and improving automation inputs.</p>",
