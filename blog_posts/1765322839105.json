  "content": "<p>Prop trading success isn’t determined only by strategy or chart work. A large part of long-term consistency—and your ability to pass evaluations or maintain funded accounts—comes from understanding the details behind your trades. Execution logs provide that visibility. They show what actually happened, not what you recall after volatility and emotion blur the moment.</p><p>For traders using automation such as TradeRx, execution logs become even more valuable. They document each trade in a structured, transparent format so you can verify rule compliance, identify adjustments, and monitor progress across multiple accounts without relying on memory alone.</p><p>This guide explains how to interpret prop trading execution logs in a practical, methodical way—whether you’re working through an evaluation or managing several funded accounts.</p><hr><h1><strong>Why Execution Logs Matter in Prop Trading</strong></h1><p>Evaluations and funded accounts come with strict guidelines: daily loss limits, trailing drawdown, restricted trading times, minimum trading days, and profit targets. A trader can follow their strategy perfectly yet still fail an evaluation simply by overlooking one of these rules.</p><p>Execution logs help prevent that outcome. They provide:</p><ul><li><p>A record of every order and outcome</p></li><li><p>A clear timeline of activity</p></li><li><p>Insight into risk behavior</p></li><li><p>Evidence of rule-following</p></li><li><p>A basis for refining strategy and process</p></li></ul><p>Without logs, a trader is forced to piece together events from memory—a process prone to bias. With logs, trading becomes a measured workflow that can be reviewed calmly and improved intentionally.</p><hr><h1><strong>What TradeRx Logs Capture</strong></h1><p>A TradeRx execution log typically includes:</p><p>◇ Account<br>◇ Trade direction<br>◇ Trade time (entry and exit)<br>◇ SL, TP, TSL, and TSLT values<br>◇ Quantity<br>◇ Balance before trade<br>◇ Balance after trade<br>◇ PnL<br>◇ Notes (e.g., <em>PASS</em>, <em>Already passed</em>, <em>Hit Max Drawdown</em>, <em>Cutoff applied</em>)</p><p>The data is simple, but the interpretation can be layered. Each field reveals something meaningful about decision quality, discipline, and compliance.</p><hr><h1><strong>How to Interpret Each Part of the Log</strong></h1><h2><strong>Account Identifier</strong></h2><p>Indicates whether a trade belongs to an evaluation or funded account.<br>Interpretation focus:</p><ul><li><p>Evaluations: proximity to pass level, rule adherence</p></li><li><p>Funded: daily and trailing drawdown, payout eligibility</p></li></ul><p>Account context frames how each trade should be judged.</p><hr><h2><strong>Direction</strong></h2><p>Shows whether the trade was long or short.</p><p>Why this matters:</p><ul><li><p>Helps identify directional bias across multiple trades or accounts</p></li><li><p>Useful for checking whether system logic is symmetrical or skewed</p></li><li><p>Highlights if certain directions consistently underperform</p></li></ul><p>Directional consistency is an important observation in intraday futures trading.</p><hr><h2><strong>Entry &amp; Exit Times</strong></h2><p>Time stamps show when trades occurred relative to:</p><ul><li><p>Market sessions</p></li><li><p>Economic events</p></li><li><p>Volatility pockets</p></li><li><p>Cut-off windows</p></li></ul><p>For evaluation accounts, time analysis is crucial. A trade taken too close to the daily stop time or during a restricted event window may invalidate your progress.</p><hr><h2><strong>Stop Loss (SL)</strong></h2><p>Indicates the system-defined dollar risk for the trade.</p><p>Interpretation:</p><ul><li><p>SL too large → risk concentration</p></li><li><p>SL too small → premature exits in volatile markets</p></li><li><p>SL varied across trades → adaptive sizing in play</p></li></ul><p>Consistent SL practices help maintain drawdown stability.</p><hr><h2><strong>Take Profit (TP)</strong></h2><p>Where TP is fixed, the logic is straightforward.<br>When TP is labeled <em>TradeRx</em>, it was calculated dynamically based on:</p><ul><li><p>Current account balance</p></li><li><p>Distance to profit target</p></li><li><p>Evaluation requirements</p></li></ul><p>This field helps you verify the appropriateness of your risk/reward structure.</p><hr><h2><strong>TSL &amp; TSLT</strong></h2><p>Trailing stop behavior highlights how a system protects open profits.<br>Interpreting these values provides insight into:</p><ul><li><p>How aggressively profits are secured</p></li><li><p>How trades adapt to changing volatility</p></li><li><p>Whether funded accounts use more conservative rules</p></li></ul><p>This is especially important for traders who prioritize steady account growth over large individual wins.</p><hr><h2><strong>Quantity</strong></h2><p>Position size reveals how well risk rules were applied.</p><p>Interpretation points:</p><ul><li><p>Did size increase after a win when it shouldn’t?</p></li><li><p>Was size reduced appropriately near drawdown thresholds?</p></li><li><p>Are quantity changes tied to volatility or account-specific rules?</p></li></ul><p>Size tells a story about discipline.</p><hr><h2><strong>Balance Before / After</strong></h2><p>Shows the true impact of the trade on account health.</p><p>Two key insights often come from this:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Trend of balance progression</strong><br>Smooth curves often win evaluations; large swings rarely do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk relative to drawdown limits</strong><br>If a trade reduces the cushion too far, even a win may indicate unnecessary risk-taking.</p></li></ol><hr><h2><strong>PnL</strong></h2><p>PnL is useful only in context:</p><ul><li><p>PnL trends matter more than individual trades</p></li><li><p>Clusters of small losses may indicate timing issues</p></li><li><p>Outlier wins or losses often reveal structural behavior changes</p></li></ul><p>You’re not looking for the biggest number—you’re looking for predictable outcomes.</p><hr><h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2><p>This is one of the most informative sections. Notes may include:</p><ul><li><p>PASS (evaluation target achieved)</p></li><li><p>Already passed (no more trades taken)</p></li><li><p>Hit Max Drawdown</p></li><li><p>May qualify for payout</p></li><li><p>Event window restriction applied</p></li><li><p>Cutoff enforced</p></li></ul><p>Notes help confirm that the system respected rules, even when you weren’t monitoring every account.</p><hr><h1><strong>Interpreting Logs in Context: Case Examples</strong></h1><h2><strong>Evaluation Account Example</strong></h2><p>A sequence of trades shows:</p><ul><li><p>One controlled loss early</p></li><li><p>Two modest winners</p></li><li><p>Balance exceeds the required pass threshold</p></li><li><p>Notes confirm <em>PASS</em> and halt further trades</p></li></ul><p>Interpretation:<br>The system showed discipline by not overtrading after reaching the target. This is normal and expected behavior for evaluation mode.</p><hr><h2><strong>Funded Account Example</strong></h2><p>A single trade pushes the balance above the payout eligibility threshold.<br>The notes show: <em>May qualify for payout</em>.</p><p>Interpretation:<br>This confirms your account reached the minimum required level without exceeding drawdown or violating rules. Logs support payout verification if requested.</p><hr><h1><strong>Turning Logs Into Practical Insight</strong></h1><p>Over time, consistent log review helps you spot:</p><ul><li><p>Ideal trading windows</p></li><li><p>Setup strengths and weaknesses</p></li><li><p>Rule-related adjustments</p></li><li><p>Early signs of drift in execution behavior</p></li><li><p>Overtrading trends</p></li><li><p>Stress points near drawdown levels</p></li><li><p>Volatility sensitivity</p></li></ul><p>This transforms logs from “data storage” into a working tool for refinement.</p><hr><h1><strong>Common Log Interpretation Errors</strong></h1><p>◇ Looking only at PnL instead of process<br>◇ Ignoring compliance notes<br>◇ Reviewing one day at a time instead of weekly patterns<br>◇ Focusing on individual trades instead of overall consistency<br>◇ Not comparing multiple accounts for bigger trends</p><p>Good interpretation avoids emotional narratives and sticks to observable evidence.</p><hr><h1><strong>How Execution Logs Support Prop Firm Reviews</strong></h1><p>Occasionally, prop firms request proof of rule-following.<br>Execution logs provide:</p><ul><li><p>Time-stamped entries</p></li><li><p>Event window behavior</p></li><li><p>Size decisions</p></li><li><p>Drawdown proximity</p></li><li><p>Proof that no disallowed trades occurred</p></li></ul><p>This transparency helps avoid disputes and protects payout eligibility.</p><hr><h1><strong>Advanced Techniques for Professionals</strong></h1><ul><li><p>Use color-coding for streak analysis</p></li><li><p>Overlay trade times on charts for spatial insight</p></li><li><p>Track your balance cushions across multiple accounts</p></li><li><p>Monitor slippage by comparing entry price vs. signal time</p></li><li><p>Annotate logs weekly to form a learning archive</p></li></ul><p>Once logs become a habit, they serve as a personal trading audit system.</p>",
