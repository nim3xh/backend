  "content": "<p>Prop trading firms have transformed how futures traders access capital — but the path to earning that capital isn’t a single straight line. Traders move through two distinct environments: <strong>evaluation accounts</strong> and <strong>funded accounts</strong>. Each phase has its own rules, incentives, constraints, and risks.</p><p>These stages are not interchangeable, and successful automation requires treating them as separate trading ecosystems. This guide breaks down the real differences and how professional systems like <strong>TradeRx</strong> and <strong>Dr. Markets</strong> adapt to each phase with precision.</p><hr><h2><strong>Evaluation Accounts: The Simulation With Teeth</strong></h2><p>Evaluation accounts are <strong>demo-based</strong> environments designed to test a trader’s discipline, risk control, and consistency. They replicate live market behavior but use simulated capital. Passing the evaluation unlocks live trading access — but breaching any rule forces a reset.</p><h3><strong>Key Characteristics of Evaluation Accounts</strong></h3><p>◇ 100% demo — no live capital at risk<br>◇ Must reach a predefined <strong>profit target</strong> (e.g., $3,000 on ES)<br>◇ Strict <strong>daily loss limits</strong> and <strong>trailing drawdowns</strong><br>◇ Violations end the evaluation immediately<br>◇ Reset fees apply when traders start over</p><p>Evaluations are not about generating amazing profit. They are tests of <strong>rule adherence</strong>. For example, in NQ evaluation accounts, TradeRx enforces timing filters and volatility gating to prevent accidental rule breaches during unstable conditions.</p><hr><h2><strong>Tactical Considerations in the Evaluation Phase</strong></h2><p>Evaluation trading is more about protecting the account than maximizing output.</p><p>◇ Overtrading destroys evaluations faster than bad setups<br>◇ Algorithms must use <strong>precision triggers</strong>, not constant firing<br>◇ Session filters (e.g., avoiding the first 15 minutes of ES RTH) reduce whipsaw failures<br>◇ Trailing drawdowns punish <strong>early profits</strong> more than later profits<br>◇ High <strong>reward-to-risk</strong> setups outperform scalping within evaluation limits</p><p>Dr. Markets uses evaluation data to refine logic trees — adjusting position sizing, volatility sensitivity, and momentum thresholds to match the constraints.</p><hr><h2><strong>Funded Accounts: Capital-Backed, Rule-Bound Freedom</strong></h2><p>Once funded, traders move to a live-money environment. Fills, slippage, depth, spreads, and commissions all become real. The rules don’t vanish — they simply <strong>evolve</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Key Characteristics of Funded Accounts</strong></h3><p>◇ Live capital, live fills, live slippage<br>◇ Profit targets shift into <strong>payout thresholds</strong><br>◇ Some firms switch from trailing to <strong>static drawdowns</strong><br>◇ Violating rules typically results in <strong>account termination</strong><br>◇ Scaling plans limit contract size even after profitability</p><p>For example, a GC strategy that thrived in evaluation using 2-lot micro-breakouts may fail in funded mode unless adjusted for live fill slippage and spread widening.</p><hr><h2><strong>Trade Execution in Funded Accounts</strong></h2><p>Live dynamics require more sophisticated execution logic.</p><p>◇ TradeRx recalibrates stops to handle real-world slippage<br>◇ Dr. Markets disables certain high-frequency paths to avoid latency traps<br>◇ Execution speed impacts entries and exits<br>◇ Commission-aware logic determines whether scalps remain profitable</p><p>Funded trading isn’t a harder version of evaluation — it’s a <strong>different game</strong>. Profit matters, but rule compliance still sits at the core.</p><hr><h2><strong>Comparative Snapshot: Evaluation vs Funded Logic</strong></h2><p>◇ <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Rule obedience is priority #1<br>◇ <strong>Funded:</strong> Capital preservation becomes priority #1<br>◇ Evaluation uses synthetic fills; funded accounts use <strong>real market depth</strong><br>◇ Evaluation punishes drawdowns automatically; funded accounts involve discretionary oversight<br>◇ Evaluation favors simple models; funded accounts require robustness and adaptability</p><hr><h2><strong>Common Misconceptions</strong></h2><p>◇ <strong>“If it passed evaluation, it’ll crush funded.”</strong><br>False. Live fill quality, spread dynamics, and slippage change everything.</p><p>◇ <strong>“Rules get easier after funding.”</strong><br>No — they shift into different forms, like payout buffers and consistency clauses.</p><p>◇ <strong>“One strategy works in both phases the same way.”</strong><br>Not sustainably. Each phase requires unique calibration.</p><hr><h2><strong>Risk Management Evolution</strong></h2><p>Risk definitions change across phases.</p><p>◇ <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Risk = rule-breach probability<br>◇ <strong>Funded:</strong> Risk = capital exposure vs. edge confidence</p><p>Dr. Markets adapts to this by reducing risk per trade as equity rises, ensuring traders don’t accidentally breach during scaling or payout phases.</p><hr><h2><strong>Funded Payout Structures: Hidden Constraints</strong></h2><p>Funded accounts introduce new layers that affect performance:</p><p>◇ <strong>First-profit lockups</strong> delay withdrawals<br>◇ Scaling plans limit size growth<br>◇ Monthly consistency rules affect payout timing<br>◇ Withdrawals may reset drawdown buffers</p><p>A 3-point ES scalp strategy may pass evaluation easily, but live commissions and spreads could eliminate net profitability.</p><hr><h2><strong>Psychological Load Differences</strong></h2><p>Evaluation and funded phases create <strong>different emotional pressures</strong>.</p><p>◇ <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Fear of rule breach dominates behavior<br>◇ <strong>Funded:</strong> Fear of real capital loss or payout delays becomes primary</p><p>TradeRx aligns aggressiveness or conservativeness with account status — reducing discretionary risk during high-tension phases.</p><hr><h2><strong>How Automation Navigates the Transition</strong></h2><h3><strong>In Evaluation Mode</strong></h3><p>◇ Prioritizes rule compliance over PnL<br>◇ Uses synthetic fills to model tight entries<br>◇ Locks in hard stops and trailing anchors</p><h3><strong>In Funded Mode</strong></h3><p>◇ Adapts stops and targets to real slippage<br>◇ Dynamically sizes based on live equity buffers<br>◇ Adjusts exits around latency and spread rules</p><p>TradeRx applies session-specific filters, while Dr. Markets manages execution delays to prevent fills outside tolerance bands.</p><hr><h2><strong>Evaluation-to-Funded Failure Points</strong></h2><p>Many traders pass evaluation but lose their funded account within weeks because they overlook:</p><p>◇ Commission impact on real net profit<br>◇ Slippage vs synthetic fill differences<br>◇ Adjusting size for live drawdown math<br>◇ Misinterpreting scaling rules and increasing size too soon</p><p>Automation built with <strong>phase-aware logic</strong> prevents these failures early, ensuring a clean transition.</p><hr><h2><strong>FAQ: Evaluation vs Funded Accounts</strong></h2><p><strong>What happens if I breach a rule in evaluation?</strong><br>Your evaluation ends or resets, usually requiring a fee to start again.</p><p><strong>Can I use the same bot in both phases?</strong><br>Yes, but it must adapt. Execution logic, stops, and timing filters must adjust for funded conditions.</p><p><strong>How do trailing drawdowns work in funded trading?</strong><br>Some firms lock them at peak balance; others continue trailing until payout.</p><p><strong>Why do funded accounts still enforce rules?</strong><br>To protect the firm’s capital — funding doesn’t remove risk.</p><p><strong>Which metrics matter most in evaluation?</strong><br>Drawdown control, timing discipline, and smooth equity curves.</p><p><strong>Is passing or staying funded harder?</strong><br>Staying funded — because real-world execution adds friction.</p><p><strong>Can I withdraw profits immediately?</strong><br>Most firms require hitting a profit buffer or waiting period.</p><hr><h1><strong>Conclusion: Know the Terrain, Trade the Map</strong></h1><p>Evaluation and funded accounts are not two halves of the same experience — they are <strong>distinct environments</strong> with unique demands. Traders who understand these differences design strategies that adapt intelligently across both phases.</p><p>Automation tools like <strong>TradeRx</strong> and <strong>Dr. Markets</strong> help bridge this gap by enforcing rule integrity in evaluation and optimizing execution under live-market conditions in funded accounts.</p>",
